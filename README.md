informsJournalsTools
====================

Tools for streamlining the preparation of manuscripts for INFORMS Journals, 
especially Operations Research and Informs Journal on Computing.

* A script for converting LateX extracted from LyX using the AMS Style
  to source including INFORMS' Style
* A script that updates abbreviations to match the INFORMS convetions.
* A style file for INFORMS-formatted bibliography
* Some tests

Please fork ad nauseum, as I will have limited bandwidth for testing
until the next time I submit a paper to an INFORMS Journal. 
If you do create a derivative work please let me know so I can add a link to it here,
and please point to the "parent" package from your README file.
